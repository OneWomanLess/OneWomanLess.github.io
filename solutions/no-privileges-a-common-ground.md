As a principle for any solutions.

I find it extremly important to not create privilegdes, as they may backfire on anyone who accepts them; and may attract people who are interested in the priviledge itself and social status that comes with it rather then the field it was created for.

We need **a common ground**, an equity, not-exclusivity - not priviledges, or special treatment of inclusivity.
