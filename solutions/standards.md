Standards for a project governance that get under international legislation.

Something similar to what the foundation [Childbirth with Dignity](https://rodzicpoludzku.pl/co-robimy/) does in Poland for women's rights during childbirth. There is now a [standard of mother's care during childbirth](https://rodzicpoludzku.pl/poznaj-swoje-prawa/standard-opieki-okoloporodowej-poznaj-swoje-prawa/ii-trymestr-3/) which is a legally binding document which all medical institutions are obligated to follow.

The foundation has also many other initiarives that can be an inspiration for a similar systemic change.
