the "survival rate" in the FOSS projects space for women is so low, that one needs to be very risk-taking to enter the field, knowing all the data.

Why not creating like a highly-risk-sports life insurence for those who decide to try?

There could be a mandatory tax on projects which receive founding from European Comission or elsewhere, to fuel the fund. Or a civil-responsibility-assurance found, so women and other individuals from the minorities can choose to engage only in projects which give some minimal guarantees, if nothing else that they will receive monetary compensation for their demanges.

If there is no discrimination, the found won't be needed any more. So it will self-regulate and motivate with a financial punishment to change the culture.
