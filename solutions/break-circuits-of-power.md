For mobbing and bullying.

But how?

>
> **Universalism as a lesser evil**
>
> It has become an almost Republican value to defend universalism. The study is clearly intersectional because it speaks of women of color as well as women in general. So what is universalism?
>
> For example, if your company claims to be inclusive, and I ask if there are safe spaces, you tell me you don't need them because everyone can express themselves in the mixed space. That's what being universalist is all about.
> 
> And that doesn't suit me, on the one hand, it ignores those who may have been hurt before and who, even if your company is sincerely benevolent, will not be able to express themselves in the mixed space. And also because the mixed space is the comfort zone, and the coercion zone of the dominant group. If your mixed space is mainly right-wing, you will see that those on the left do not dare to talk too much about politics.
>
> Single-sex conversation spaces are a safeguard so that victims can speak up and realize that this behavior is definitely not normal (because the mixed-sex space can give the impression, with its dirty jokes all day long, that it is normal).
>
> But then there need to be circuit breakers to ensure that the offending behaviors are properly condemned. Today, those who behave badly will most often go unpunished. Victims and whistleblowers need to be able to turn to someone they find safe and have the guarantee of not being blamed later.
> 
> *Some large companies guarantee that any complaint filed with HR will be investigated by an external consulting firm. Your company can set a circuit breaker tailored to its structure and size.*
>
>
> **Take action!**
>
> Let's be clear, *men occupy the space to speak on the subject today. So if you use it to minimize the problem, it's clearly because you're part of the problem*. And if you don't say anything, we don't know, we imagine that you're not on the right side. So take action, it's not complicated to say that Robert messed up. It's not even very complicated to go see Robert and tell him that he messed up. In the Mixed space, if there are 9 guys, one predator and 8 who don't say anything, it's sure that the problem will seem widespread. Whereas if there are one or two who take a stand against it, it's more of a cultural problem, but an issue that HR or management should have addressed earlier.
