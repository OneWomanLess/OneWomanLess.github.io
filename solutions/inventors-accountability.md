On the Open Data Institute website, in the description of [the ODI team](https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-odi-team/) we can read that:

> Sir Tim Berners-Lee \
> President & Co-founder of the ODI
> 
> Sir Tim Berners-Lee, invented the World Wide Web, an internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing in 1989.

(the great invention it is!)

...and than [following the link:](https://theodi.org/profile/tim-berners-lee/)

> Sir Tim is the Founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the standard-setting organisation for the web, and the co-founder of the Web Foundation whose mission is that the World Wide Web serves humanity. 

Although there is no institutional accountability in the Internet, 
understood as the lack of reliable governance and protection structures in many digital (including free and open-source) projects, which is a systemic issue, 
one may consider the inventor's accountability.

Mariha claims, that she was earlier discriminated and mobbed from a FOSS project what created a gread distress for her, among many other harms that are hard to quantify. Later her project, which is now under the ODI umbrella as a part of SolidProject ecosystem, has been misappropriated from her, with a knowledge and silent approval of the whole community, including Sir Tim. She was effectively wiped-out from the history of the project she instigated and nurtured.

Under the search for a lawyer to consult the case with them. Even the greatest invention may need a correction.
