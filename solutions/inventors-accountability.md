On the Open Data Institute website, in the description of [the ODI team](https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-odi-team/) we can read that:

> Sir Tim Berners-Lee \
> President & Co-founder of the ODI
> 
> Sir Tim Berners-Lee, invented the World Wide Web, an internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing in 1989.

(the great invention it is!)

...and [than:](https://theodi.org/profile/tim-berners-lee/)

> Sir Tim is the Founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the standard-setting organisation for the web, and the co-founder of the Web Foundation whose mission is that the World Wide Web **serves humanity**. 

Yet, the Internet based, online violence keeps growing [source needed]. It is also an issue that disproportionately more affects women\* and people from any minorities than man and the majority.

Although there is **no institutional accountability** in the Internet, 
understood as the lack of reliable governance and protection structures in many digital (including free and open-source) projects, which is a systemic issue, 
one may consider the **inventor's accountability**. 

_Even the greatest invention may need a correction. \
Alfred Nobel, after inventing a dynamite, founded a prize to reward efforts in Peace (among others)._

> **Gender based Violance**
> The European Commission defines gender-based violence as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender or _violation that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately_.

The particular case, as a lever:

> [Mariha](https://github.com/mariha) claims, that in 2021-22 she was discriminated and mobbed with a particular cruelty from a FOSS project, what created a great distress for her, among many other significant moral harms that are hard to quantify. She was unable to find any help for that, as she was a newcommer to the FOSS community and the project was developed by an informal, international group of people of much greated power than she had, and there is no institutional accountability in the space.
> 
> Later, in Feb 2024, at the invitation of the host of SolidWorld, with his encouragement and assurance that everything will be good, she presented her new community project, OHN/sleepy.bike (now SolidCouch/tired.bike) at the conference. Following private harassements before and during the presentation, that she reported and which was dismissed - the project, which came from her earlier experiences, which she started as a voluntary project to keep in contact with software development while having a baby, and which she kept going at the times when her father was terminaly ill and passed away, has been misappropriated/hijacked from her and the originating OHN project/community, by one of the main contripbutors, who she made a co-admin in the project, as a common in FOSS communities practice and to welcome his contributions, and whose suspected close one earlier harassed Mariha during SolidWorld. It involved silancing Mariha, making hard demands on her (to give away the domain), spreading misinformation and blackmailing her. The misappropriation happaned with a knowledge and silent approval of the whole SolidProject community, including Sir Tim. The project remains under the [ODI](https://theodi.org/) umbrella as part of the SolidProject ecosystem. 
> 
> Subsequantly, she was asked to not present the project until the conflict is resolved - which technically is still ongoing, under the ODI Ombudsman investigation, following the second report of the issue in Oct '24. She left SolidProject spaces under ODI's governance out of distress (Winter '24/'25). The project has been presented at Solid Symposium (Spring '25) without mentioning of its origins.

_If you are a lawyer you are welcome to take the case. Mariha can provide all the documentation._

As a compansation of harms (proposition):

- no contact with Mariha from [@mrkvon](https://github.com/mrkvon), for good enough reasons (removed from here to not get derailed by relatively insignificant matters). An obligation to state the origins of the project and that it has been misappropriated from OHN under [@mariha](https://github.com/mariha)'s administration, whenever presenting the project, including on its own website.

- actions towards gender equality in free software development, in particular women anti-discrimination

- an obligation on ODI, to make a worldwide educational campaign about negative social aspects of the Internet - online violence. Lack of empaty in remote interactions, leading to dehumanisation - as the pain on the other side is very real, despite the distance, and it gets normalised. Lack of natural 'stop' condition for someone's else suffering, an evolutionary self-regulation mechanism for any activity/behaviour before it becoming a norm, including new technological inventions and their (potentially initially unintended) social usages - however, SoLiD stands from Social Linked Data.
In-particular online violence against women and girls - as (apparently!) they seem to be less valued by the society and people allow themselves to lower standards of behaviours when interacting with them.\

+ an obligation on W3C on [standardisation]({% link solutions/standards.md %}) for online communities, including free software communities to encode human rights / account for human dignity / non-discrimination.
