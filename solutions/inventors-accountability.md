On the Open Data Institute website, in the description of [the ODI team](https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-odi-team/) we can read that:

> Sir Tim Berners-Lee \
> President & Co-founder of the ODI
> 
> Sir Tim Berners-Lee, invented the World Wide Web, an internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing in 1989.

(the great invention it is!)

...and than [following the link:](https://theodi.org/profile/tim-berners-lee/)

> Sir Tim is the Founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the standard-setting organisation for the web, and the co-founder of the Web Foundation whose mission is that the World Wide Web serves humanity. 

Although there is no institutional accountability in the Internet, 
understood as the lack of reliable governance and protection structures in many digital (including free and open-source) projects, which is a systemic issue, 
one may consider the inventor's accountability.

Mariha claims, that she was earlier discriminated and mobbed with a particular cruelty from a FOSS project, what created a great distress for her, among many other significant moral harms that are impossible to quantify. 
Later, following private harassements before and during her SolidWorld presentation, that she reported and being ensured that everything is fine - her community project, which she instigated, administered and nurtured, believing in its technological value, which is now under the ODI umbrella as part of SolidProject ecosystem, has been misappropriated from her and the originating OHN project, with a knowledge and silent approval of the whole SolidProject community, including Sir Tim. She was effectively wiped-out from the history of the project of a potentially high social impact, according to her, that she instigated and nurtured + her other upper-project and the community is gone as well - except the main developer's who took his work with him, wrecking the work and efforts of many others. She left SolidProject under ODI's governance out of distress.

_Looking for a lawyer to consult the case with them. \
Even the greatest invention may need a correction._

As a compansation of harms - an obligation on ODI lead by Sir Tim, to make a worldwide educational campaign about negative social aspects of the Internet: lack of empaty in remote interactions, leading to dehumanisation - as the pain on the other side is very real, despite the distance. Lack of natural 'stop' condition for someone's else suffering, an evolutionary self-regulation mechanism for any activity/behaviour before it becoming a norm, including new technological inventions and their (potentially unintended) social usages. 
In-particular online violence against women and girls - as (apparently!) they happened to be less valued by the society and people allow themselves to lower standards of behaviours when interacting with them. 

+ an obligation on W3C on standardisation (see solutions/standards)
