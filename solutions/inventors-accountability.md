On the Open Data Institute website, in the description of [the ODI team](https://theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-odi-team/) we can read that:

> Sir Tim Berners-Lee \
> President & Co-founder of the ODI
> 
> Sir Tim Berners-Lee, invented the World Wide Web, an internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing in 1989.

(the great invention it is!)

...and [than:](https://theodi.org/profile/tim-berners-lee/)

> Sir Tim is the Founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the standard-setting organisation for the web, and the co-founder of the Web Foundation whose mission is that the World Wide Web **serves humanity**. 

Yet, the Internet based, online violence keeps growing [source needed]. It is also an issue that disproportionately more affects woman\* and people from any minorities than man and the majority.

Although there is **no institutional accountability** in the Internet, 
understood as the lack of reliable governance and protection structures in many digital (including free and open-source) projects, which is a systemic issue, 
one may consider the **inventor's accountability**. 

Even the greatest invention may need a correction.

(Alfred Nobel, after inventing a dynamite, founded a prize to reward efforts in Peace (among others)).

The particular case, as a lever:

> [Mariha](https://github.com/mariha) claims, that in 2021-22 she was discriminated and mobbed with a particular cruelty from a FOSS project, what created a great distress for her, among many other significant moral harms that are hard to quantify. She was unable to find any help for that, as she was a newcommer to the FOSS community and the project was developed by an informal, international group of people of much greated power than she had, and there is no institutional accountability in the space.
> 
> Later, in Feb 2024, at the invitation of the host of SolidWorld, with his encouragement and assurance that everything will be good, she presented her new project, OHN/sleepy.bike (now SolidCouch/tired.bike) at the conference. Following private harassements before and during the presentation, that she reported but that was initially dismissed - her community project, which came from her earlier experiences, a project which she instigated, administered and nurtured for about 2-3 years, believing in its technological value, at the time when her father was terminaly ill and passed away, has been misappropriated from her and the originating OHN project/community, with a knowledge and silent approval of the whole SolidProject community, including Sir Tim. The project remains under the [ODI](https://theodi.org/) umbrella as part of the SolidProject ecosystem. 
> 
> She did what she was asked for, and her involevent and participation at an already chellanging time for her, was covertly impaired (by the harassement and later conflict and no help, and later request to not present the project and by being silenced). The project was hijacked, and moreover, she was effectively wiped-out from the history of it - a project of a potentially high social impact, according to her, with a violation to any standards of social interaction, respect for another human being and her rights + her other upper-project (OHN) and the community is gone as well - except the main developer's who took the work by him and others with him. Subsequantly, she was asked to not present the project until the conflict is resolved - which techically is still ongoing, under the ODI Ombudsman investigation, following the second report of the issue in Oct '24. She left SolidProject under ODI's governance out of distress (Winter '24/'25). The project has been presented at Solid Symposium (Spring '25) without mentioning of its origins.

_If you are a lawyer you are welcome to take the case. Mariha can provide all the documentation._

As a compansation of harms:
- an obligation on ODI, to make a worldwide educational campaign about negative social aspects of the Internet - online violence. Lack of empaty in remote interactions, leading to dehumanisation - as the pain on the other side is very real, despite the distance, and it gets normalised. Lack of natural 'stop' condition for someone's else suffering, an evolutionary self-regulation mechanism for any activity/behaviour before it becoming a norm, including new technological inventions and their (potentially initially unintended) social usages - however, SoLiD stands from Social Linked Data.
In-particular online violence against women and girls - as (apparently!) they seem to be less valued by the society and people allow themselves to lower standards of behaviours when interacting with them. 

+ an obligation on W3C on standardisation for online communities (see solutions/standards) encoding human rights / accounting for human dignity, especially and including minorities, all and any.

> **Gender based Violance**
> The European Commission defines gender-based violence as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender or violation that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately.
