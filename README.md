Women make up about half of a society and the population, and they tend to be pivotal vector for transfer of cultural values and norms since forever. Yet in free and open source software projects, where digital infrastructure and common tools for all of us are designed and made\*, they represent only 3% of the developers and contributors\*, compared to 7-23% in the software industry [global\*\*-US\*\*\* data]. 

We believe, on top of other economical and social inequalities that limit women's participation in the space, it is because they are not always being treated fairly in the environment, especially when faced with a conflict - and they leave, as a means of self-protection; or are being forced out, if they openly object the process. This may take a form of depriving comments and other micro-aggressions, silently accepted by everyone around; and occasional seriousy harmful power-abuse related issues with [no legal structure](https://onewomanless.github.io/solutions/legal-structure) in FOSS to keep others accountable to it and defend oneself against them.

Here we **[document](https://github.com/OneWomanLess/OneWomanLess.github.io/tree/main/personal-stories) the process of leaving** and **[advocate](https://github.com/OneWomanLess/OneWomanLess.github.io/tree/main/solutions) for non-discrimination and fair conflicts resolution**, acknowledging everyones inalienable rights\*\*\*\* and needs as a human being, in the digital space of free software communities.

We also intend to **[collect and provide]({% link get-help.md %}) some basic resources** for individuals who currently are or recently experienced **mobbing**.

We believe, creating this common ground of everyone’s inalienable rights and freedoms being respected (in the digital space not less than elsewhere), is the only way for the humanity where woman are valued equally to man, and everyone in between. So we can all equally enjoy our lives, free from systemic violence; supported by a sustainable\*\*\*\*\* free software ecosystem.

Effective _Conflict-resolution mechanisms_ is one of the design principles\*\*\*\*\* of long-enduring common-pool resources that Elinor Ostrom formulated, based on her lifelong studies on commons governance. She was awarded Nobel Prize in economy for her work on that. If we want FOSS projects environment to be sustainable, this gives **research-based justification** for the project.
