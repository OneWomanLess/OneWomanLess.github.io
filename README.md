[Open letter]({% link open-letter.md %})

Women make about half of the society, yet in free software projects, which create infrastructure for all of us, they represent only 3% of the contributors(\*), compared to 7-23% in the professional computer programming field(\*\*)(\*\*\*) [global or US data]. We believe it is because they are not treated fairly in the space and leave.

Here we document the process of leaving the space and vouch for human rights protection, like non-discrimination and the right to have a fair trial, in the digital space of free software communities.
