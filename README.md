Women make up about half of the society, yet in free software projects, where digital infrastructure and everyday tools for all of us are made, they represent only 3% of the contributors(\*), compared to 7-23% in the industry [global(\*\*)-US(\*\*\*) data]. We believe, on top of the other economical and social inequalities that limit access to the space, it is because they are not always being treated fairly in the environment, especially when the project faces a conflict - and they leave, as a means of self-protection. Objecting the process has resulted in being forced out.

Here we **[document](https://github.com/OneWomanLess/OneWomanLess.github.io/tree/main/personal-stories) the process of leaving** and **[advocate](https://github.com/OneWomanLess/OneWomanLess.github.io/tree/main/solutions) for non-discrimination and fair conflicts resolution**, acknowledging everyones inalienable rights and needs as a human being, in the digital space of free software communities.

We also **[collect and provide]({% link get-help.md %}) some basic resources** for individuals who are currently or recently experienced **mobbing**.

We believe, creating this common ground of everyone's inalienable rights being respected, is the only way for the humanity where woman are valued equally to man, and everyone in between.
