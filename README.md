Read the [Open letter]({% link open-letter.md %})

Women make about half of the society, yet in free software projects, which create infrastructure for all of us, they represent only 3% of the contributors(\*), compared to 7-23% in the professional computer programming field(\*\*)(\*\*\*) [global or US data]. We believe it is because they are not always being treated fairly in the space and leave.

Here we document the process of leaving and vouch for non-discrimination and other human rights protection, like the right to have a fair trial, in the digital space of free software communities.
