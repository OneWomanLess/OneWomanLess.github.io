You know a project that is worth showing off as a model for others to follow?

Add a file named after that project to the `wall-of-fame` directory, with a description what you believe contributes most to create the friendly environment in that project. Consider also adding a short characteristics of yourself, anything that may be relevant for the great fit you made.
