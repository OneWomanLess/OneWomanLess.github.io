I was once in a team which was using eXtremeProgramming (XP) for the operations / practices. Kent Beck wrote a book that is said to describe it well. I found it to be a good set of rules. We were rotating roles and pair programming. I also learnt by far more in that team then any other I was in. The project architect was a technically very savvy afro-american woman in her 50. which I believe adds even more creadibility to the practices, I believe they were chosen very consciously and for a good reason. 

Our dev team of 9(?) worked from 3 locations across Atlantic ocean, and that was the biggest challenge for us, especially that we took the 100% of production code (initially also tests) written as pair-programming very seriously.
