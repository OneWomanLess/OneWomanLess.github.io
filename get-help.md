> ##### 1. What Does Ostracization Look Like?
>  Ostracization, or the exclusion of a person by an individual or group.
>
> ##### 2. Why Do Workplace Bullies Use Ostracization as a Weapon?
>  _high impact, low risk_
>
> ##### 3. Why Does Ostracization Hurt So Much?
>  _evolutionary and neuropsychological perspectives_
>
> ##### 4. How Does Ostracization Promote Conformity, Stifle Creativity, and Discourage Whistleblowing?
>
> _effects on a work culture_
> 
>  To reestablish group membership, the high performer is pressured to play small or resign, perpetuating a stifling and sometimes toxic workplace culture.
>  
>  Employees who value justice and fairness over loyalty and conformity tend to be the ones who report abuse and violations of laws and ethics.
>  
> ##### 5. What Tools Are Available to Help Targets Cope With Ostracization?
>
>   - maintaining **multiple social circles**, to meet the basic social needs elsewhere when cut off at one
>   - **mindfulness practice**, to mitigate the pain
>   - **social surrogates**, or symbolic bonds that provide a psychological connection:
>     - Parasocial \
>       in which we form a one-way connection to people we do not actually know but who bring us happiness, \
>       like watching a favorite actress in a movie or enjoying a concert by a beloved musician. 
>     - Social World \
>       in which we find escape and calm by transporting to another universe through books and television, \
>       such as, situating ourselves in C.S. Lewisâ€™s Narnia
>     - Reminders of Others \
>       where we use pictures, home videos, mementos, and letters to connect to the people we love and who love us back.
>       
>  Social surrogates have also been shown to benefit trauma victims, who seek comfort from activities and rituals, instead of opening themselves up to reciprocal human relationships that may put them at risk for re-traumatization.
>  
>  Though some assume leaning on social surrogates is a sign of maladaptation and deficiency in personality, recent research indicates that social surrogates are correlated with the development of empathy, self-esteem, and other prosocial characteristics of healthy human development.
